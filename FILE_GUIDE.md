## How to use this guide

This is a **functional/relational** file guide — answers "what does each file do, what does it consume, what does it produce, what depends on it" rather than just "where does it live."

---

## §1 The naming convention contract

All AIStudio files follow a consistent naming convention. Quick reference:

| TYPE | Class | What this file IS | When you produce one | What reads it |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **STD** | B | Codified standard. Authoritative on its scope. | Codifying a rule that's been validated. | Reference when in doubt. |
| **REF** | B | Reference material. Cheat sheets, FILE_GUIDE itself. | Producing a navigational/onramp doc. | Ad hoc lookup. |
| **WIP** | B or A | Work-in-progress. Plan, audit, draft. | Capturing a multi-session investigation. | Future sessions; promoted to NOTES or absorbed into STD. |
| **NOTES** | A or B | Session-bound or topical observations. Empirical record. | Capturing what was learned, not what was decided. | Cross-session continuity; promoted to STD if pattern emerges. |
| **CONCEPT** | B | Foundational explanation. "Why this exists." | Defining a primitive or initiative. | Onboarding. |
| **SESS** | A | Permanent session archive. | End of session, summarizes outcomes. | Cross-session memory. |
| **PIPELINE** | D | Living work tracker. No date in filename. | Continuously updated each session. | Every session at start (planning pass). |
| **TMPL** | B | Reusable template (Word, PowerPoint, etc.). | Codifying a document format. | Document creation. |
| **RES** | B | Resume variant. JOB domain. | Tailoring resume for an application. | Application submission. |

**Filename pattern** (universal): `TYPE - DOMAIN - TOPIC - DATE[ - HHMM][.ext]`
**Domains**: General, AIStudio, JOB, urc

**Class A** (operational, multiple per day) → DATE + HHMM required
**Class B** (standards, daily revision max) → DATE only, letter suffix for same-day
**Class C** (code/SDLC) → no date in filename; version inside file
**Class D** (living docs) → no date in filename; date in `*Last Updated*` field

---

## §1a File Versioning Conventions

AIStudio uses two versioning patterns depending on file type. Both are mandatory for any file that is deployed or tracked.

### Shell scripts (`.sh`)

Two lines, both required, **both must match**:

```bash
# Version: X.Y.Z
VERSION="X.Y.Z"
```

### Python files (`.py`)

Header comment block at the absolute top of the file, before all imports:

```python
# Version: X.Y.Z
# Changelog: X.Y.Z — <ticket> description of change.
#            Continuation lines indented 12 spaces (aligned with description start).
# Changelog: X.Y.Z-1 — previous change (newest first).
```

Rules:
- `# Version:` must match the most recent `# Changelog:` entry — single source of truth.
- Entries are prepended (newest first) — never append at the bottom.
- One entry per version bump. Two tickets in one bump is fine.
- The header block appears before `from __future__ import annotations` and all imports.

### Class C files — version inside file, not in filename

Per §1, Class C (code/SDLC) files carry no date in the filename. The `# Version:` header is the only version signal.

---

## §2 The runtime layer — `src/` + `front_end/` + `data/`

**What runs to answer a query.**

### `src/local_llm_bot/app/` — Python application

| File | Function | Reads | Produces |
|---|---|---|---|
| `api.py` | FastAPI HTTP layer | Corpus metadata, query payload, system prompt | JSON response with citations |
| `rag_core.py` | RAG pipeline orchestration | Query, corpus index | Embedded query → retrieved chunks → reranked → LLM context |
| `ingest/pipeline.py` | Document ingestion (per-file chunked/embedded/upserted) | Files in `data/corpora/<name>/uploads/`, corpus metadata seed | `index.jsonl`, `manifest.jsonl`, Qdrant chunks |
| `ingest/loaders.py` | File-type-specific loaders | PDF/DOCX/HTML/MD files | Plain text + page metadata |
| `ingest/chunking.py` | Text chunking with overlap | Plain text | Chunks with stable IDs |
| `vectorstore/qdrant_store.py` | Vector store interface | Embeddings, metadata | Qdrant collections, similarity search |
| `ollama_client.py` | Ollama HTTP wrapper | Model name, prompt | Embedding vectors, LLM completions |
| `config.py` | Environment-driven config | OS env vars | Settings dict |

### `front_end/rag_studio.html` — UI

Single self-contained HTML file. Opens directly in browser, no server. Communicates with FastAPI backend at `localhost:8000`.

**Provides**: corpus selector, chat with citations, corpus CRUD (new/delete/rename), file upload + per-file inspect, metadata edit (description, search_guidance), help modal.

### `data/corpora/<name>/` — Document corpora

Each corpus is a self-contained folder:

| File | What it is | Who writes it |
|---|---|---|
| `uploads/` | Source documents (PDF, DOCX, etc.) | User via UI Add Files |
| `<name>_corpus_metadata.yaml` | Description, search_guidance, sources[], runtime stats | Seed at create-time, updated at ingest |
| `index.jsonl` | One row per chunk: ID, source path, page, text | Ingest pipeline |
| `manifest.jsonl` | Per-file ingest record: chunks count, last_ingested_at | Ingest pipeline |
| `trash/` | Soft-deleted files (recoverable) | UI delete |

**Demo corpus** ships with the repo. **Help corpus** is built from `docs/` + key root markdown. **SEC 10-K corpus** is downloaded from SEC EDGAR via `ais_download_sec_10k` and ingested via `ais_ingest_sec_10k`. **User corpora** are created via the UI New button — private, gitignored, no special setup required.

### `benchmarks/<corpus>/` — Benchmark questions and reports

Each corpus that has a benchmark questions file can be tested with `ais_bench`:

```
benchmarks/
  demo/
    demo_questions.yaml       ← pre-built questions for the demo corpus
    reports/                  ← timestamped benchmark reports (.md, .json, .pdf)
  sec_10k/
    sec_10k_questions.yaml    ← pre-built questions (created by ais_ingest_sec_10k)
    reports/
  <your-corpus>/
    <your-corpus>_questions.yaml  ← you write this (see format below)
    reports/
```

**Questions file format** — create `benchmarks/<name>/<name>_questions.yaml`:

```yaml
- topic: Topic Name
  questions:
    - id: unique_snake_case_id
      question: The exact question text sent to AIStudio.
      keywords: [term1, term2, term3]   # all must appear in the answer to pass
      notes: What a correct answer looks like — which document, what content.
```

**What `ais_bench` checks** — three conditions, all must pass:
1. All `keywords` appear in the answer (case-insensitive)
2. The answer includes at least one citation
3. The model doesn't hedge with "no information available" or similar phrases

**Tips for good keywords:** 2–5 distinctive terms that prove the model retrieved the right content. Use specific concepts, entity names, or regulatory terms — not generic words.

For full details and advanced options, see `TUTORIAL.md §3.4` and `HOWTO.md`.

### `prompts/system.txt` — System prompt

Loaded by `api.py` at query time. Per-corpus `search_guidance` from `<name>_corpus_metadata.yaml` is appended dynamically.

## §11 Cross-cutting workflows

### Workflow B: Producing a tailored resume

1. Read the Resume Development standard (template system + Canonical Timeline)
2. Read closest existing resume variant for proof points reuse
3. Produce `RES - Manuel Barbero - <Firm> - <Role> - <date>[<letter>].docx`
4. Update master tracker

## §12 The file-to-action map

**Quick lookup: who reads what, who writes what, what feeds into what.**

| File pattern | Reads | Writes | Feeds into |
|---|---|---|---|
| `<corpus>_corpus_metadata.yaml` | `api.py` (system prompt), UI Edit | Ingest pipeline, UI Edit | LLM routing, search_guidance display |
| `prompts/system.txt` | `api.py` | Manual edit | LLM system instructions |
| `data/corpora/<name>/uploads/*` | Ingest pipeline | UI Add Files | Corpus chunks → Qdrant |
| `data/corpora/<name>/index.jsonl` | `rag_core.py` retrieval | Ingest pipeline | Query → ranked chunks |
| `benchmarks/<corpus>/<corpus>_questions.yaml` | `ais_bench` | User-authored or auto-generated | Benchmark pass/fail evaluation |
